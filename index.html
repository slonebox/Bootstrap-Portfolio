                        <p>
                            William Mooney Sloneker--or just "Will" for short--is a student at Columbia University's bootcamp in Full Stack Development running from July 2019 to January 2020. A nonprofit professional with several years experience, Will found his way into coding through his digital marketing and fundraising work, and he hopes to find a way to apply his new technical skills to social good.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, Will has an unwavering yet frustrating devotion to its professional sports franchises and an enduring appreciation for its unique style of chili. He currently resides in Manhattan, in a tiny studio apartment with <em>just enough</em> space for him and his belongings--including a bike.

                        <p>
                            When he is not working or coding, Will is often running; he is currently training for his fourth marathon in October. He also enjoys meticulously reviewing craft beer, traveling on weekends to virtually <em>anywhere</em>, nerding over political journalism, and playing video games old and new on his Nintendo 64 and Switch.
